            This was the first time I've ever had a sleep-over and the funny
            part was that I wasn't even part of the group lol! I had an amazing
            time, although I wasn't quite able to help you guys out with the
            thesis, buuuut I got to spend time with you in the same room. Which
            for me was a huge win! you might not have been aware at the time but
            you were the main focus of that image above.

            At this point in time,<br />
            I was sooo into you... the problem was I wasn't quite sure if you
            still in a relationship as a result<br />
            I was really trying not to make it obvious ðŸ˜…

            As you already know, it was on this night when we got to talk about
            the upcoming concert of BLACKPINK, given that you're a huge fan I
            figured you'd love it if you had the chance to attend it.<br />
            So immediately after this day I set out to find clients for a
            freelance job. Hoping I'd be able to earn enough money for 2 concert
            tickets.
