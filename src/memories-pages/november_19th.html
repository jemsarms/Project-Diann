            On this amazing day I got to talk to you for what felt like seconds
            because its as if time stood still when we were sitting on that
            couch. You were breathtaking in every sense of the word, I love how
            we managed to share our thoughts and outlooks on relationships and
            told each other how much we value certain romantic aspects.
          </p>

            It was then I knew that you currently don't have a partner. <br />
            You have no idea how happy that made me feel.<br />
            In my head I was like "OMG I have an actual chance!"<br />
            But your groupmates went down the stairs and kinda ruined the moment
            for me ðŸ˜‘

            The moment I opened my eyes I was greeted with a "Kailangan mo na
            umuwi....". <br />
            <br />
            And you were right, I did need to go home because our title defense
            was just around the corner. Going home I kinda felt a little bit
            defeated, I wasn't able to convince you to go to the concert, albeit
            your reason was quite acceptable but yeaaah my plan basically went
            kaput!
